This is a project that is in the beta phase of the alpha, new features will be added when I learn how to make the graphics engine more effective as I have been testing and the graphics engine closes when adding motions to the water, so for now I will only leave 4 types of blocks

The controls are:

Movement:
W = Forward

A = Left

D = Right

S = Back

Mouse:
Right clic = Place block

Left clic = Destroy block

Choose blocks:
1 = Grass

2 = Ground

3 = Stone

4 = Brick
